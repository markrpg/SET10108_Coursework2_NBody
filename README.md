NBody Simulation
This is my implementation of my NBody simulation, it uses the brute force pair method of simulating particles with velocity and distance. 
This implementation uses an open source graphics library named SFML to draw the particles. This implementation contains different forms of 
parallelism held in different branches, using both the CPU and GPU to accelerate this simulation.
